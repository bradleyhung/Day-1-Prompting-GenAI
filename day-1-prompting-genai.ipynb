Bartholomew, with the agility of a ninja, leapt onto the window sill and followed its flight path. He watched in awe as the bee disappeared into a thicket of rose bushes, their vibrant blooms a riot of color.\n\nThe bee, he decided, was his ticket to a world beyond the familiar. He slipped out the open window, a mischievous glint in his emerald eyes. The garden, usually a place of naps and birdwatching, seemed entirely new, bursting with hidden pathways and secret smells.\n\nHe followed the bee's scent, weaving through the fragrant rose bushes, past the grumpy hedgehog who grumbled about \"annoying furry things,\" and under the watchful gaze of the fat robin who scolded him for trespassing. He was captivated by the world beyond his usual domain, a world of vibrant hues, earthy scents, and buzzing sounds.\n\nHis journey led him to a towering oak, its branches reaching towards the sky like a giant's fingers. There, he found the bee, nestled in a blossom, its tiny wings still. Bartholomew, despite his adventurous spirit, was a gentle soul. He watched the bee, a mixture of concern and awe filling him.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow fell upon them. A giant hand, smelling of earth and dew, reached for the bee. It was the old gardener, a kind soul with eyes as warm as the sun. He gently lifted the bee, placing it on a nearby leaf.\n\n\"Poor little fella,\" he murmured, \"just needs a rest.\"\n\nBartholomew watched, a sense of wonder washing over him. This, he realized, was not just a bee, it was a creature of nature, fragile and beautiful. His adventure had opened his eyes to a world beyond his comfort zone, a world of wonder and respect.\n\nWith a satisfied purr, Bartholomew turned and made his way home, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of orange and gold. He slipped back through the window, the familiar scent of home comforting him. He might have missed his catnip toy, but he had found something far more valuable - an appreciation for the simple beauty of the world around him.\n\nAs Bartholomew curled up for a well-deserved nap, he knew this wasn't the end of his adventures.

One afternoon, as his human, a kindly old woman named Agnes, was tending her roses, Bartholomew saw his chance. \n\nThe gate to the garden was left ajar, beckoning like a portal to a fantastical world. With a flick of his tail and a silent meow of determination, Bartholomew slipped out. The world outside was a riot of sights and smells. He sniffed at the fragrant blooms of a nearby flower shop, startled a plump pigeon on a park bench, and chased a rogue butterfly through a maze of sunflowers.\n\nHe soon found himself at the edge of a bustling city park, a jungle of concrete and metal, alive with the chattering of people and the honking of cars. Bartholomew, ever the brave explorer, navigated the maze of legs and wheels with the grace of a seasoned veteran. He weaved between tourists and joggers, his green eyes gleaming with excitement.\n\nHe stumbled upon a street performer, a young woman with a melodious voice and a battered guitar. Drawn by her music, Bartholomew approached cautiously, then, emboldened by the warmth of her gaze, hopped onto the stage. He sat, bathed in the spotlight, his ginger fur shimmering, as the music washed over him. He purred, his tail twitching with delight.\n\nThe crowd gasped, then cheered. Agnes, who had been frantically searching for him, arrived at the scene, her face etched with worry. But the sight of Bartholomew, a small orange star on the stage, brought a wide smile to her face. She watched with pride as he took a bow, accepting the cheers of the crowd with a regal nonchalance.\n\nBartholomew returned home that evening, his fur a little mussed, his belly full of adventure. As he curled up on Agnes' lap, he purred contentedly, his heart overflowing with the magic of the day. He knew, in his cat heart, that he had found his adventure, not in a faraway land, but in the unexpected beauty of his own world. He had discovered the world was full of wonders, and he, Bartholomew, a ginger tabby with a heart full of wanderlust, was ready to explore them all. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        # These are the default values for gemini-1.5-flash-001.\n        temperature=1.0,\n        top_k=1,\n        top_p=0.95,\n    ))\n\nstory_prompt = \"You are a creative writer.

He watched, with envy, the birds flitting through the branches of the old oak tree, their tiny wings blurring against the bright blue sky. One day, the garden gate swung open, left carelessly by a visiting child. Bartholomew saw his chance. He squeezed through the gap, his heart thrumming with a mix of fear and excitement.\n\nThe world outside was a sensory overload. Smells - earthy, metallic, sweet, and pungent - bombarded his nose. The sun, warm on his fur, felt different from the filtered sunlight of the garden. He crept along the cobbled path, his whiskers twitching, his green eyes wide with wonder.\n\nHe found himself in a bustling marketplace, a riot of colours and sounds. Vendors hawked their wares, children laughed, and a dog, twice his size, barked furiously at a passing pigeon. Bartholomew, being a brave but sensible cat, decided to take a detour. He darted down a narrow alleyway, the smell of fresh herbs filling his nostrils. He discovered a hidden courtyard, a secret oasis of peace amidst the city's clamour.\n\nA kindly old woman, tending to her herb garden, caught sight of him. She smiled, offering him a saucer of milk. Bartholomew, cautious at first, eventually accepted the offering, purring gratefully. The woman, her face crinkled with age and wisdom, told him tales of her own feline companions, of their adventures and mishaps.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the rooftops, Bartholomew knew he had to return home. The familiar scent of his garden drew him back. He slipped through the gate, a little wiser, a little braver, and a whole lot more grateful for the comfort of his own space.\n\nBack in the garden, the oak tree seemed taller, the sky a deeper blue. Bartholomew, nestled in his favourite sunbeam, closed his eyes, the memory of the bustling marketplace, the hidden courtyard, and the kind old woman, a warm glow within him. He knew, deep in his heart, that his adventures were just beginning. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        # These are the default values for gemini-1.5-flash-001.\n        temperature=0,\n        top_k=64,\n        top_p=0,\n    ))\n\nstory_prompt = \"You are a creative writer.

The sunbeams that usually danced across his favorite rug were dull, the birds outside chirping the same monotonous tune. He yearned for something more, somethingâ€¦ adventurous.\n\nOne day, a delivery truck arrived, its back doors groaning open to reveal a mountain of cardboard boxes. Bartholomew's eyes gleamed. This was it! His chance for adventure. He slipped out the cat flap, a silent shadow, and crept towards the truck.\n\nHe found a box just his size, a perfect vessel for his journey. He squeezed inside, the cardboard walls smelling of faraway places and exciting possibilities. The truck rumbled to life, and Bartholomew, nestled in his cardboard haven, felt a thrill course through him.\n\nThe journey was a blur of sights and sounds. He saw bustling city streets, rolling green hills, and a vast blue ocean. He heard the honking of horns, the chirping of crickets, and the crashing of waves. He was a traveler, a nomad, a feline explorer!\n\nFinally, the truck stopped. Bartholomew, his heart pounding with anticipation, peeked out of his box. He was in a small village, nestled amongst the mountains. The air was crisp and clean, the scent of pine needles filling his nostrils. He had never smelled anything like it.\n\nHe emerged from his box, stretching his legs and taking in the sights. A little girl, with eyes as bright as the morning sun, spotted him. She giggled and held out her hand. Bartholomew, usually wary of strangers, felt a strange pull towards her. He rubbed against her hand, purring softly.\n\nThe girl, whose name was Lily, took him home. Her family welcomed him with open arms, offering him warm milk and a cozy bed by the fire. Bartholomew, for the first time in his life, felt a sense of belonging. He had found his adventure, and it had led him to a place where he was loved and cherished.\n\nHe never forgot his journey, the thrill of the unknown, the sights and sounds that had filled his senses. But he also knew that sometimes, the greatest adventures are the ones that lead you home. And so, Bartholomew, the adventurous cat, settled into his new life, a contented purr rumbling in his chest, his heart filled with the memories of his journey and the warmth of his new family. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        temperature=0.1,\n        top_p=1,\n        max_output_tokens=5,\n    ))\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.

Here's a breakdown of what it does and why you might use it:\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Customizes your command line prompt:** Instead of the default prompt (usually just a username and machine name), it adds Git-related information like:\n    * Current branch name\n    * Whether there are uncommitted changes\n    * Status of upstream tracking\n    * Whether you are in a detached HEAD state \n* **Provides flexibility:** You can customize the appearance of the prompt using color themes, symbols, and various configuration options.\n* **Integrates with virtual environments:**  It shows the name of the currently activated virtual environment (e.g., Python virtual environments, Node.js virtual environments).\n* **Uses a separate configuration file:** You can customize the prompt behavior and appearance further in the `.bash-git-rc` file in your Git repository.\n* **Handles prompt updates:** It intelligently updates the prompt whenever there are changes in your Git repository or virtual environment.\n\n**Why use it:**\n\n* **Enhanced awareness:** The dynamic Git prompt keeps you informed about the status of your Git repository, making you more productive and less prone to errors.\n* **Improved workflow:** It helps you quickly identify the current branch, the state of your working directory, and other important information without having to explicitly run git commands.\n* **Customization:** The script offers a wealth of customization options, allowing you to tailor the prompt to your preferences and workflow. \n\n**To use this script:**\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the code in a file named, for example, `git-prompt.sh` \n2. **Source the script:** Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file: \n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/git-prompt.sh \n   ```\n   Replace `/path/to/git-prompt.sh` with the actual path to the saved script.\n3. **Reload your shell:**  Close and reopen your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to make the changes take effect.\n\nYou'll now see a more informative Git prompt in your terminal.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":64},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
